New Process:

1) Find the Median
2) Find the biggest delta between the lowest and highest numbers; the biggest delta means that number touches the edge of the canvas and is the highest/lowest point of the sparkline
3) Find the vertical scale multiplier


NEXT STEP - Make both the min and max touch the edges of the canvas in order to (properly?) stretch out the graph

OR

find a way to 'flip' the whole canvas on the horizontal..
